### Using SSH Tunnels with your applications:

**Basic usage - bcusg**

On Windows once you have created and opened your tunnels you need to configure you applications to use them.

This guide cannot possibly cover each and every program. Also your program needs to support proxying in some way.

This will usually be in the settings or preferences somewhere under the title of

Proxy  / Network Settings / Connection Settings

Now with most apps you can either proxy directly using settings or with addons or plugins of some type like foxyproxy in firefox.

#### FireFox's Connection settings

#### Firefox - firfx

[Firefox Foxy Proxy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/)

This is the best method for firefox. A very customizable proxy addon.

#### Chrome - chrme

[Chrome Proxy SwitchySharp](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchysharp/dpplabbmogkhghncfbfdeeokoefdjegm)

Chrome does not give the user any useful built in network/proxy options. The plugin below is the best choice to do this (it is a good plugin)

Once you have installed the plugins, click on it's icon and click on `Options`.

Now in the options window enter you proxy information.

After you have saved, you can click on the icon to select from any configured proxies.
