Here are some basic set-up steps for btsync.

Info: Automatically sync files via secure, distributed technology. [btsync homepage](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html)

### Installation

You will need to execute these commands in [SSH](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=12)

~~~
wget -qNP ~/btsync http://btsync.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/btsync_x64.tar.gz
tar -xzf ~/btsync/btsync_x64.tar.gz -C ~/btsync && rm -f ~/btsync/btsync_x64.tar.gz
~~~

We are going to use a custom conf file with some tweaks. Please use this file and not the dummy conf generated by the binary. The custom conf has some basic things already configured.

Use this command to get it. It will be downloaded to the right location.

~~~
wget -qNO ~/btsync/sync.conf http://git.io/tnT60g
~~~

You must now configure your `~/btsync/sync.conf` before you run the program.

You can edit this file over ftp. Please see this FAQ for how to do this properly [Text editing - Over FTP or SFTP](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=219)

Or in SSH:

~~~
nano -w ~/btsync/sync.conf
~~~

This is the part you must edit.

~~~
//  Make sure to pick a PORT by changing #### then Change USERNAME and PASSWORD. Leave the host as 0.0.0.0
"listen" : "0.0.0.0:####",
"login" : "USERNAME",
"password" : "PASSWORD"
  }
~~~

Something like this:

**Important note:** The `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` you create here is unique, just for the btsync Web Gui. It is not related to any Feral provided passwords.

**Important note:** Pick a port between `6000` to `55000`

~~~
//  Make sure to pick a PORT by changing #### then Change USERNAME and PASSWORD. Leave the host as 0.0.0.0
"listen" : "0.0.0.0:34567",
"login" : "superman",
"password" : "drowssap"
  }
~~~

Once you have done this edit, execute this command. It will send itself to the background.

~~~
~/btsync/./btsync --config ~/btsync/sync.conf
~~~

To access the Web Gui you must use a browser and visit the URL:

**Important note:** where `username` if your Feral username and `server` is the name of your Feral server that hosts the slot btsync is installed on:

**Important note:** `https` is not supported by bysync. You must only use `http`

~~~
server.feralhosting.com:PORT
~~~

For example:

~~~
chronos.feralhosting.com:34567
~~~

or

~~~
username.server.feralhosting.com:PORT
~~~

For example:

~~~
superman.chronos.feralhosting.com:34567
~~~

Either will work.

### Kill btsync

To Kill the processes use this command to find running instances:

~~~
ps x | grep btsync | grep -v grep
~~~

Kill all btsync processes this way:

~~~
killall -9 btsync -u $(whoami)
~~~
