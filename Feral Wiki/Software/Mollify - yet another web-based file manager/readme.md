### 1: What it does

[Mollify](http://www.mollify.org/index.php)

- Each user and group can have different folders published
- Customized notifications from different user events
- File actions available: download, rename, copy, move and delete

### 2: Installation

2.1: Install MySQL from your [Install Software page](https://www.feralhosting.com/manager/slot/install?).

2.2: Move to the WWW root using this command via SSH

~~~
cd ~/www/$(whoami).$(hostname)/public_html/
~~~

2.3: Download and unzip the file using wget and zip via SSH using this command 

~~~
wget -qO mollify.zip http://www.mollify.org/download/latest.php
unzip -qo mollify.zip
~~~

2.4: Create a file called `configuration.php` using this command: 

~~~
nano -w mollify/backend/configuration.php
~~~

Copy and paste this:

~~~
<?php
    $CONFIGURATION = array(
        "db" => array(
            "type" => "mysql",
            "host" => "localhost",
            "database" => "mollify",
            "user" => "[MYSQL_USERNAME]",
            "password" => "MYSQL_PASSWORD",
            "table_prefix" => "mollify_"
        )
    );
?> 
~~~

To edit via shell. Don't forget to save.

2.5. Copy and paste the following into configuration.php

**If you are using mysql:** It is suggested you create a limited user following this FAQ [adminer](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=116). This is an optional but recommended step, to create a limited user.

**If you are using mysql:** You can use your root and provided pass and Mollify will create the data base for you during installation

2.6: After saving the` config.php`, visit the following link to complete your installation:

~~~
http://user.server.feralhosting.com/mollify/backend/install/
~~~

So for example:

~~~
http://john.zeus.feralhosting.com/mollify/backend/install/
~~~

*Make sure to note the initial username/password used.*

### 3: Post-Installation

In order to make the most out of Mollify, you'll need to create *Published Folders*, Users and Groups.  These can all be managed from within the Admin Pane and it is very straight forward.  You can link to anywhere within your Feral slot and the files will become accessible, even private folders. *Once created, make sure directories, groups and users are checked.*

Mollify also supports a plugin architecture.  You can get the plugins from their [download page](http://code.google.com/p/mollify/downloads/list).  

Download the plugins you want to install, extract them then upload to the following directories:

Plugins that start with `plugin` go in the  folder:

~~~
~/www/user.server.feralhosting.com/public_html/mollify/backend/plugin/
~~~

Plugins that begin with `viewer` go in the folder:

~~~
~/www/user.server.feralhosting.com/public_html/mollify/backend/plugin/FileViewerEditor/viewers/
~~~

NOTE: Using the Flowplayer plugin as an example, the downloaded file will be `viewer_flowplayer_1.0.zip`. Do not upload this extracted folder, but go inside and find the `Flowplayer` folder. That is the folder to be uploaded to the `viewer` directory.

~~~
cd ~/www/$(whoami).$(hostname)/public_html/mollify/backend/plugin/FileViewerEditor/viewers/
wget -qN http://mollify.googlecode.com/files/viewer_flowplayer_1.0.zip
unzip -qo viewer_flowplayer_1.0.zip && rm -f viewer_flowplayer_1.0.zip
~~~

Once plugins are installed into their appropriate folders, [reference my pastebin configuration](http://pastebin.com/twzZae9t). 

Add the new information to your `configuration.php` file and save. Some changes require you to check for an update to the mysql database.  You can check for updates by going to:

~~~
http(s)://user.server.feralhosting.com/mollify/update
~~~

Your configuration.php file should now look like this:

~~~
<?php
    $CONFIGURATION_TYPE = "mysql";
    $DB_HOST = "";
    $DB_PORT = "";
    $DB_DATABASE = "DATABASE";
    $DB_USER = "root";
    $DB_PASSWORD = "xxxxx";
    $DB_SOCKET = "/media/xxx/home/xxx/private/mysql/socket";
    $DB_TABLE_PREFIX = "mollify_";
 
        $PLUGINS = array(
                "FileViewerEditor" => array(
                        "viewers" => array(
                                "Image" => array("gif", "png", "jpg"),
                                "TextFile" => array("txt", "php", "html"),
                                "JPlayer" => array("mp3"),
                                "Divx" => array("avi", "mkv"),
                            //  "VLC" => array("mp4", "mkv", "avi")
                                "FlowPlayer" => array("f4v", "flv", "mp4")
                        ),
                        "previewers" => array(
                                "Image" => array("gif", "png", "jpg")
                        ),
                        "editors" => array(
                                "TextFile" => array("txt")
                        ),
                )
        );
?>
~~~

NOTE: The commenting out `//` in front of VLC under `$PLUGINS = array` is necessary.  When removing the `//` it will not load the Mollify page. Not sure why this is, but you may have different experiences with it.

After updating the configuration file and completing the settings in the Admin Pane, you can access Mollify by going to: `http(s)://server.feralhosting.com/user/mollify/`

### 4: Notes

1: Where you see `username` in directories/url's, insert your Feral username and where you see `server`, insert your server name.

2: Playing video files may require add-ons or plug-ins to be present in your browser, such as divx+, quicktime or java.

3: Under the Installation section, the $ are not necessary.
