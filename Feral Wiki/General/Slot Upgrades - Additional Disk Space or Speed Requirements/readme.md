An upgraded slot is a larger one. For example, doubling a Neon slot is known as a Xenon as it offers more than twice the bandwidth and disk space.

To upgrade your slot please:

**1)** Purchase the slot from our website.
**2)** Wait until you receive the slot. 
**3)** Then open a ticket requesting a data transfer (optional)
**4)** Request a refund on your current slot (optional).

You do not need to register a separate account for an upgrade.
