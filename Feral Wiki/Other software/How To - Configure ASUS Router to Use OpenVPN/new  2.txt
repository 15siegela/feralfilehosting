A couple questions I had while writing this:
1. Poll interval - is it needed? Works fine when set to "0"
2. Accept DNS configuration - I had pre-configured my router to use OpenDNS's dnscrypt. With the vpn enabled, the OpenDNS test page verifies that I'm still using their dns. This occurs for both "Disabled" and "Strict" settings. In the logs, I noticed that the OpenVPN config uses Google's public dns (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4)

I realize some of my settings may be redundant or overkill, but they work. I also realize that Feral is a seedbox provider, not a vpn. Still, knowledge is valuable and there are already howto's on here for accomplishing similar things (entunnel, android, etc..)
Perhaps we could also get howto's for accomplishing this using dd-wrt and a more generic tomato firmware (Asus uses modified tomato). Many have already been written; they just need to be tweaked for feral.

Looking forward to any feedback.

Cheers
