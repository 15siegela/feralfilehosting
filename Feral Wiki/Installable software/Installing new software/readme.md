To install new software, request an installation from the [**Install Software** link in your Manager](https://www.feralhosting.com/manager/).

This process is automated and is waiting on server-to-server communication which occurs routinely every 5 minutes. After it has started it can take anywhere from a few seconds to 20 minutes to set up and complete; in the longer cases, this is due to MySQL being compiled for your user account.

If there is an error this will be reflected on your software status page and may occur occasionally due to depending on third-parties (e.g. external source code repositories). You will probably want to delete the necessary directories it may have created and then request a second install. Failing this, open a [support ticket](https://www.feralhosting.com/support) and things will be sorted out manually.
