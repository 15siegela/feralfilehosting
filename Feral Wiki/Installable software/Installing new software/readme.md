To install new software, request an installation from the [**Install Software** link in your Manager](https://www.feralhosting.com/manager/).

This process is automated and is waiting on server-to-server communication which occurs on demand from the user requesting an installation. After it has started it can take anywhere from a few seconds to 20 minutes to set up and complete. Please be patient while this process 


You can install it again using the Install Software page for your relevant slot if the software installation has not completed or is not working.

If this still does not work, open a [support ticket](https://www.feralhosting.com/manager/tickets/new) and things will be sorted out manually.
