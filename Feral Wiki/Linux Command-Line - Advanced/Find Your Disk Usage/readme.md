To check the amount of space used in your slice, [log into the shell](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=12) and type this command:

~~~
du ~/ -s --si
~~~

There might be a delay before any response is displayed â€” it may take up to 3 minutes for the system to calculate the amount of data in your slice.

You can setup an alias for this command to help you remember it better. Please see the [Aliases FAQ](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=31).
